## About 
Novoda dashboards share 'at a glance' challenges and experiences of our globally distributed colleagues.
Dashboards are viewed in two differents contexts: _Office_ & _Project_.

### Office: Informational, Operational, Cultural
Transparency & community is at the heart of Novoda and our tools must reinforce our values. 
[SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) Office screens should:

* Link Novoda's digital & physical community
* Ensure awareness of company ceremonies & process
* Share achievements, challenges & goals
* Share organic team building opportunities

### Project: Strategic, operational, analytical
Sharing humanised, simplified and useful information is the best way our teams can be aligned to a project's goal. Our teams care about our contributions and their outcomes and so always want to share in an understanding of the metrics of success.
